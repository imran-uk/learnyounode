learnyounode: imran edition
===========================

This is just my progress in doing the "learnyounode" tute. 

By keeping it in github I can keep my progress in sync while I develop across multiple machines.

Original can be found [here](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)

## get started

* clone the repo from github
* npm install learnyounode
* `./node_modules/.bin/learnyounode`
